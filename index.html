        <p> This is a test "We would like to invite you to 
        participate in our survey regarding the PEARLS Program at the
         University of Windsor. PEARLS: Promoters of Experiential, 
         Active, and Research-Based Learning in Science is
          a program at the University of Windsor that aims to develop
           interactive learning in the Faculty of Science. A flyer 
           attached to this email will provide more information and an 
           overview of the program. If you have participated in the program, great! 
           We want to know your thoughts and feedback on your experiences with us, as your opinion matters to us. 
           If you havenâ€™t participated in the program,
            we want to invite you to this survey to learn about why that might be,
            and if you would be interested in participating in the future. 
            Your opinion matters to us too. "</p>
